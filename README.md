# Happy Tails Trails
 Trails to take with furry friends


Portfolio Project â€“ to React

1.
1.	The main differences between Bootstrap and React is using components in Javascript for React and coding in JS rather than everything in HTML.
2.	This allows for easy changes.  React also allows you to use components to pass data to a child component (from a parent component) thereby coding less (using the props (properties) object).
2.
1.	Directory and App
2.	Directory is going to be the parent component of a location object which will then have child objects of maps, information and images.  Apps is going to be the component of the entire application.
